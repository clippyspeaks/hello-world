# hello-world
Just...  this place.  For... yanno.... things.

Hello.  I am darkwHing.  I am the system administrator for a small publisher that handles everything in-house in an environment that is very mac focused on the user side, and very windows focused (with a dash of linux) on the server side.
I'll be using this spot to catalogue some of my powershell and bash scripts and some stuff that I use for work so that I can easily get back to them.  

Maybe they will be of some use to someone else?  Maybe.
