# hello-world
Just...  this place.  For... yanno.... things.

Hello.  I am clippyspeaks.  

Over 10 years in IT, started at the bottom as a field tech.  Moved to IT manager in a small organization and now System Administrator in an Enterprise environment.

This place is mostly a place for me to keep quick scripts I've made or used to do little tasks here and there, maybe you'll find it useful.
